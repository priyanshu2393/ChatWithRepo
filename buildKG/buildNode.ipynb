      "**Explanation of Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import necessary modules:**\n",
      "   - `pydantic` for data validation.\n",
      "   - `BaseModel`, `ValidationError` from pydantic.\n",
      "   - `typing` for hinting\n",
      "2. **Define `TokenData` Pydantic Model:**\n",
      "   - A `TokenData` class is created, inheriting from `BaseModel`.\n",
      "   - It defines the expected structure and data types of the data that will be encoded in the token.  Critically, it includes `sub` (subject, which is mandatory) and `exp` (expiration, which is optional).  You can add other fields to this model as needed to enforce validation on other token claims.\n",
      "3. **Data Validation:**\n",
      "   - Inside `create_access_token`, the input `data` dictionary is now validated against the `TokenData` model using `TokenData(**data)`.\n",
      "   - If the data does not conform to the model (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types), a `ValidationError` will be raised.  This is caught, and a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive message, indicating that the token data is invalid.\n",
      "4. **Using the validated data:**\n",
      "   - If validation is successful, `token_data.dict()` converts the Pydantic model instance into a dictionary suitable for JWT encoding.\n",
      "5. **Type Hinting:** Added type hints for better readability and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to use the updated function and update the caller functions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you need to adapt the calling functions `signup` and `login` to pass the correct data that conforms to the `TokenData` model.  Specifically, the `sub` field is now *required*.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# signup (in routes.py)\n",

      "\n",
      "- **`sub` is mandatory:**  The `data` dictionary *must* contain the `sub` key.  I've updated both `signup` and `login` to include it.\n",
      "- **Error Handling:**  I've added a `try...except` block around the call to `create_access_token`.  If the data passed to `create_access_token` is invalid, it will raise a `ValueError`.  The `except` block catches this and raises an `HTTPException` to return a 500 error to the client.  You can customize the error handling as appropriate for your application.  For example, you might log the error or attempt to correct the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This revised solution provides robust data validation for your JWTs, ensuring that the tokens contain the expected information and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.  Remember to adjust the `TokenData` model to match the specific claims you need to validate in your tokens.\n"
